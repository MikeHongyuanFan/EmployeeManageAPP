# API Caching Implementation for Employee Management System

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of API caching for the Employee Management System mobile app, which was identified as a high-priority optimization in Phase 1.1 of the optimization plan.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Cache Manager

The `ApiCacheManager` class has been implemented to handle caching of API responses. This class provides the following functionality:

- **Save data to cache**: Stores API responses with timestamps and expiration durations
- **Retrieve data from cache**: Returns cached data if available and not expired
- **Remove data from cache**: Deletes specific cache entries when data is updated
- **Clear cache**: Removes all cached data (used during login/logout)

The cache uses SharedPreferences for storage, with data serialized to JSON format.

### 2. Enhanced API Service

The `ApiServiceEnhanced` class extends the base `ApiService` class and adds caching functionality:

- **Read operations**: First check the cache before making network requests
- **Write operations**: Update the API and invalidate relevant cache entries
- **Cache durations**: Different cache durations based on data volatility:
  - Short (2 minutes): Tasks, meetings, leave requests, WFH requests, working hours
  - Medium (10 minutes): Employees, documents
  - Long (1 hour): Current employee profile, leave balance

### 3. Cache Invalidation

Cache invalidation is implemented for all operations that modify data:
- Creating/updating tasks invalidates the tasks cache
- Creating/updating meetings invalidates the meetings cache
- Creating/updating leave requests invalidates both leave requests and leave balance caches
- Creating/updating WFH requests invalidates the WFH requests cache
- Clock in/out operations invalidate the working hours cache
- Document operations invalidate the documents cache
- Login/logout operations clear all cached data

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Network Requests**: Frequently accessed data is served from cache
2. **Improved Performance**: Faster response times for cached data
3. **Reduced Server Load**: Fewer API calls to the backend
4. **Better Offline Experience**: Some data available even when offline
5. **Battery Optimization**: Fewer network operations means less battery usage

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with the following scenarios:
- Initial data load (cache miss)
- Subsequent data loads (cache hit)
- Data modification (cache invalidation)
- Login/logout (cache clearing)

## Future Improvements

1. **Persistent Cache**: Implement a more robust storage solution for larger responses
2. **Compression**: Add compression for cached data to reduce storage usage
3. **Prefetching**: Implement background prefetching of likely-to-be-needed data
4. **Sync Queue**: Add a queue for operations performed while offline

## Conclusion

The API caching implementation successfully addresses the requirements outlined in Phase 1.1 of the optimization plan. It provides a significant performance improvement by reducing network requests and serving frequently accessed data from local storage.
