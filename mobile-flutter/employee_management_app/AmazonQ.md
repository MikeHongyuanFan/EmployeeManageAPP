# Employee Management App - Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **API Base URL**: 
   - Changed from `localhost` to `10.0.2.2` in `api_service.dart` to allow Android emulators to connect to the host machine's services
   - Added ability to change the API URL at runtime through the login screen
   - Added persistence of the API URL in SharedPreferences

2. **Connection Handling**:
   - Improved connection testing with faster HEAD request first
   - Reduced timeout from 10 to 5 seconds to avoid long waits
   - Added advanced options in login screen to test connection and update server URL
   - Removed connection test from login flow to prevent double timeout
   - **NEW**: Added mock API service to work without a backend server

3. **WorkingTime Model Conflict**: Resolved the conflict between two different implementations in `working_hours.dart` and `working_time.dart` by:
   - Making `working_time.dart` export the implementation from `working_hours.dart`
   - Enhancing the `WorkingTime` class to handle both API formats

4. **Document Upload and Sharing**: Fixed issues with document sharing and uploading:
   - Corrected the handling of `shared_with` field in the API requests
   - Improved error handling in document-related functions

5. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling in various parts of the app:
   - Added timeout to API connection test
   - Improved error messages to be more user-friendly
   - Added try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions

6. **Date Formatting**: Fixed potential crash in `document.dart` when parsing dates

7. **Offline Development Mode**:
   - Added a mock API service that returns hardcoded data
   - Modified the app to work without a backend server
   - Added a flag in main.dart to easily switch between real and mock API

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Update Dependencies**: Consider updating the outdated packages in `pubspec.yaml`

2. **Backend Connection**: Ensure the backend server is running and accessible at the configured URL before testing the app with real API

3. **Testing**: Test all features with both employee and manager roles using the provided test credentials

4. **Error Handling**: Add more comprehensive error handling throughout the app

5. **UI Improvements**: Consider adding loading indicators and better error messages for a better user experience

## How to Test the App

### With Mock API (No Backend Required)

1. Make sure `USE_MOCK_API = true` in `main.dart`
2. Run the app using `flutter run`
3. Login with either:
   - Username: `employee`, Password: `password123` for Employee role
   - Username: `manager`, Password: `password123` for Manager role

### With Real Backend

1. Set `USE_MOCK_API = false` in `main.dart`
2. Make sure the backend server is running
3. Run the app using `flutter run`
4. On the login screen, tap "Show Advanced Options"
5. Enter the correct server URL for your environment:
   - Android Emulator: `http://10.0.2.2:8000/api`
   - iOS Simulator: `http://localhost:8000/api`
   - Physical Device: `http://<your-computer-ip>:8000/api`
6. Tap "Update Server URL" and then "Test Connection"
7. If the connection is successful, login with the test credentials
